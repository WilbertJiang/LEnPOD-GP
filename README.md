# Welcome to PODTherm-GP!
PODTherm-GP is a data-learning based thermal simulator without any assumptions, which can offer 3D dynamic thermal simulations of semiconductor chips accurately and efficiently. 
This `README.md` provides tutorial-like details on how to install and use PODTherm-GP. It can be further integrated into the performance-power-thermal simulation toolchains as a thermal model.
