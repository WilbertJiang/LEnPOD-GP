# Welcome to LEnPOD-GP!
LEnPOD-GP is a data-learning based thermal simulator for large-scale many-core chip, derived from [EnPOD-GP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167926024000658) approach by introducing the concepts of truncation domain and generic truncated domains. LEnPOD-GP approach can be utilized to perform 3D dynamic thermal simulations of  large-scale many-core chips accurately and efficiently. 
This README provides tutorial-like details on how to install and use LEnPOD-GP. It can be further integrated into the performance-power-thermal simulation toolchains as a thermal model. If you use any component of PODTherm-GP, please cite:
